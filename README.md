# registration-form-test
Hello!

This is a nicely structured project to test a rregistration form on the website demoqa.com.
For tests, I used Selenide & JUnit5. Some of the inputs are randomized with Java Faker lib.

All the files that you might be interested in are probably <a href = https://github.com/alena-shs/registration-form-test/tree/master/src/test/java/tests>here</a>.
But you are free to explore the project structure itself!
